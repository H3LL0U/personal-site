    <h1>Project Goal</h1>
    <p>The goal of this project is to investigate the effectiveness of phishing attacks and social engineering via email, while simultaneously teaching users how to recognize and avoid these attacks. The project focuses on raising awareness about the methods used by attackers to deceive victims, as well as providing practical guidelines and strategies to identify phishing attempts.</p>

    <h2>How the Project Achieves This</h2>
    <p>The project collects and sends emails to students, each with a unique link to a website. When users visit the site, they are confronted with a login page, which they can only access via the provided link. As soon as they begin typing in the password field, they are redirected to an informative page that explains the mistake and provides tips for recognizing phishing attacks.</p>
    <p>To store user data, the project uses MongoDB. Information like the time of visit, whether the user began typing, and email details are collected. All emails are securely encrypted to ensure privacy.</p>
    
    <p>Through this process, the project aims to help users better identify phishing attempts and learn how to protect themselves online.</p>
